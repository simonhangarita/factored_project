I couldn't run the build for the app even though I tried uninstalling Node.js and installing it again. I also tried some solutions that I found online, and I even tried creating the project from scratch.
But finally, I couldn't create the build folder for the React project.
So, I failed in the process of deploying the app, and for that reason, I cannot really provide an explanation of how to run the app for someone who doesn't know anything about system engineering or programming.
Because running this project without deploying it involves using commands in the terminal for installing dependencies and navigating through folders in the terminal.
It may even require configuring the virtual environment depending on the IDE used for running the project.

So here's an explanation of how to run the app for someome that knows a little bit about system engineering.
I am going to explain the process using pycharm ide but the process is very similar using another ide.
First of all you have to install Python and Node.js which you can install for free online following a tutorial or the documentation for each one.
Then pycharm ide as well as most of the ides has the option to clone the repository.
In this case you go to the VCS option and then click on Get from Version Control...
